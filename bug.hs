This code suffers from a subtle bug related to Haskell's laziness and infinite data structures.  The `fibs` function generates an infinite list of Fibonacci numbers.  The `take 10 fibs` part correctly takes the first 10 elements. However, the problem lies in the `sum` function.  Because `fibs` is an infinite list, `sum fibs` attempts to sum an infinite number of elements, leading to non-termination. Even though we only take the first 10 elements, the `sum` operation still tries to evaluate the entire infinite list after the first 10 elements.
